I’m a passionate game developer and designer with a strong foundation in C#, C++, and Blueprint scripting, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Design in Game Design at Artemisia College of Design, Indore.

My journey started with a love for games and evolved into a career driven by creativity, technical curiosity, and a relentless desire to build immersive, engaging experiences.
