## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate **game developer** and designer got my **Bachelor of Game Design Degree** from **Artemisia College of Design, Indore**. I specialize in **C#, C++, and Blueprint scripting**, with hands-on experience in **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

In addition to programming, I have experience in 3D modeling, rigging, basic animation and 2D Art using tools like Autodesk Maya and ZBrush. You can check out my art and asset work on my [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/bindo56).

My goal is to build immersive, engaging games and gameplay systems with a focus on storytelling, interaction, and technical polish.
